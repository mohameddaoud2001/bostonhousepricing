The features in the Boston Housing dataset, which are used to predict house prices, are as follows:

1. **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town.
2. **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
3. **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if the tract bounds the river; 0 otherwise).
5. **NOX**: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).
6. **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
7. **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.
8. **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
9. **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
10. **TAX**: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
11. **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
12. **B**: Proportion of Black residents by town (calculated as 1000(Bk - 0.63)² where Bk is the proportion of Black residents).
13. **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower-status population.
14. **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (This is the target variable).

These features represent various socioeconomic, environmental, and structural factors that influence housing prices in the dataset. The goal is to use these features to predict the target variable, `MEDV` (median house value).

Here's a breakdown of the different sections of the document and what they cover:

### 1. **Understanding the Dataset**

   - **Overview**: This part involves loading the Boston dataset into a DataFrame and adding column names to it for better readability.
   - **Actions**:
     - Created a new column for the target variable (house price).
     - Conducted basic dataset inspection (`.info()`, `.describe()`).
     - Checked for missing values and basic statistical summaries like mean, standard deviation, etc.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Overview**: The section focuses on understanding feature relationships and data trends.
   - **Actions**:
     - Ran correlation analysis between independent variables and the target variable.
     - Identified highly correlated features and discussed multicollinearity.
     - Visualized relationships using plots like scatter plots and heatmaps.
     - Introduced the importance of checking linearity for regression tasks.

### 4. **Preparing Dataset for Model Training**
   - **Overview**: Preparing the dataset for model training, including feature selection, data splitting, and normalization.
   - **Actions**:
     - Split data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
     - Standardized the dataset using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to ensure features are on the same scale.
     - Prepared independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables.

### 5. **Training the Model**
   - **Overview**: Training a linear regression model on the prepared data.
   - **Actions**:
     - Imported and initialized the `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn.linear_model`.
     - Trained the model using `.fit()` on training data.
     - Output the coefficients and intercept of the linear regression equation.
     - Discussed the interpretation of coefficients and intercept.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Overview**: Evaluating the model’s performance using various metrics.
   - **Actions**:
     - Used performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's accuracy.
     - Visualized residuals to check for normality and uniformity.
     - Discussed assumptions of linear regression and how well the model fits the data.
     - Introduced R² and adjusted R² as indicators of model fit.

### 7. **Prediction with New Data**
   - **Overview**: How to use the trained model to predict outcomes for new, unseen data.
   - **Actions**:
     - Demonstrated how to reshape and standardize new data before making predictions.
     - Used `.predict()` to predict house prices for new input values.
     - Highlighted the importance of applying the same transformations to new data as during model training (e.g., standardization).

### 8. **Pickling the Model File**
   - **Overview**: Saving the trained model using the pickle format for future use in deployment.
   - **Actions**:
     - Demonstrated how to save the trained model as a `.pkl` file using `pickle.dump()`.
     - Showed how to reload the model using `pickle.load()` and use it to make predictions.

### 9. **Setting Up GitHub and VS Code**
   - **Overview**: Guide on how to set up the environment for coding and deployment using GitHub and VS Code.
   - **Actions**:
     - Cloned a GitHub repository.
     - Opened the project in VS Code.
     - Explained the importance of using Git for version control.
     - Discussed setting up the workspace and preparing to commit changes to GitHub.

### 10. **Tools and Software Required**
   - **Overview**: List of tools and software necessary for building and deploying the project.
   - **Actions**:
     - Provided links to create accounts and download necessary software like GitHub, VS Code, and Heroku.
     - Highlighted the importance of having these tools for both local development and deployment.

### 11. **Creating a New Python Environment**
   - **Overview**: Walkthrough on how to create a new virtual environment for the project to isolate dependencies.
